# Heart-Disease-Prediction-System - Machine Learning
Built an end-to-end machine learning pipeline in Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn) to predict the likelihood of heart disease from medical data with different learning models
The dataset used is the [UCI Heart Disease Dataset](# ü´Ä Heart Disease Prediction - Machine Learning Pipeline

This project implements a complete **machine learning pipeline** to predict heart disease based on patient medical attributes.  
The dataset used is the [UCI Heart Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease) (Cleveland subset, 303 samples).

## üìÇ Project Overview

The pipeline includes:
- **Data cleaning** (duplicates, outlier capping)
- **Categorical encoding** (one-hot for medical categorical attributes)
- **Feature engineering** (age grouping, heart stress ratio, risk score)
- **Feature selection** (RandomForest importance + SelectKBest)
- **Model training and evaluation** with:
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN, tuned with GridSearchCV)
  - Decision Tree (tuned with GridSearchCV)
  - Logistic Regression
  - Gaussian Naive Bayes
- **Evaluation metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
